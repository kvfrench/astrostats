Total: 27/30

1. 9/10 - For part 3., only one case applied, but you computed both cases, which is why part 4. seemed redundant. My wording could have been better. For part 5, your statement "The rejection region defined in part 3, is anything that falls outside of the confidence interval." is not consistent with the plot of the error bar and rejection region. See my Figure 1.
2. 8/10 - See my solution. From the P value, one can compute what the z value was. However, you compared a z value with a P value directly.
3. 10/10 - I agree with your statement that as stated, it sounds like P is a probability. This is part of the problem with P values. The most obvious interpretation is wrong.
