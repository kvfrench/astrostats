1	How is part 1. related to problem HW #1, problem 6?

Part 1 of the Binomial Experiment problem is related to Hw#1, problem 6 - the Random Walk Simulation - because both rely on two outcomes. In the random walk simulation, it’s a step to the left or to the right, and in the binomial distribution, it’s success or failure. Another way in which these are similar, is that both part 1 of the binomial experiment, and the random walk simulation from HW1, is that both are history, or memory - independent. The outcome of an experiment is not biased by the outcome of the previous one. 

2. What is an interpretation of the meaning of the constraint k≪np?

This means that the number of actual successes is much small than the number of predicted successes. Presumably, this applies to the portion of the distribution where fewer successes are actually observed, such as the left tail.

3. You are given a list of 10,000 0's and 1’s and the claim that the values were generated by Bernoulli trials. How would you test this claim?

I would assign one value as successes, and plot the successes in a histogram, to see if the plot of observed successes versus the probability of expected successes, roughly matches the binomial distribution. I think this is a decent test of the claim that the values were generated by Bernoulli trials, however, it’s still possible that these 10000 values could have been generated using some other “random” means, and could still approximate a similar distribution.
